These are the two links of the same type of blog site, which I coded with PHP first and recoded with Laravel Framework. Each of them is online. PHP version is one of my oldest works in PHP, that's why it's quite primitive. I coded it about 1 year ago when I was learning PHP. Laravel version is the newest one, it's more dynamic, works pretty fast, and secure. On the other hand, the Laravel version has some modifications and additions different from the PHP version.
